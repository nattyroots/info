Directories
If you installed via the package manager, the data directory /var/lib/mongodb and the log directory /var/log/mongodb are created during the installation.

By default, MongoDB runs using the mongodb user account.
 If you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, 
 you must also modify the permission to the data and log directories to give this user access to these directories.

Configuration File
The official MongoDB package includes a configuration file (/etc/mongod.conf).
 These settings (such as the data directory and log directory specifications) take effect upon startup. 
That is, if you change the configuration file while the MongoDB instance is running, you must restart the instance for the changes to take effect.


sudo service mongod start
sudo service mongod stop
sudo service mongod restart
sudo service mongod status
/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log
