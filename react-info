npx Create React App Generation
In the next lecture Stephen will be going over how to install Create React App globally and generate the application. As of npm@5.2.0 we can now avoid this global install and instead use npx to generate the app on the fly to get the most current libraries and avoid many dependency conflicts.

Instead of this:
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app client

Just do this:
npx create-react-app client


Official docs on CRA usage with npx are available here:
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#quick-start



-------------
npm install --save redux react-redux react-router-dom

creating the APP:
1. will have 2 root files:
    index.js - initial bootup logic for react and Redux = data layer control(Redux)
    App.js - rendering layer control  - React layr, React router

naming:
name with capital (i.e App.js): if giving file exporting Class or React component
name with lowercase (i.e index.js) if giving file returns just a function or functions

-------------
in front end we can use "import" statement because we use "webpack and buble"
witch gives us acess to es2015 modules

on backend we use nodejs witch has acess to nodejs that uses "require" syntacs
