npx Create React App Generation
In the next lecture Stephen will be going over how to install Create React App globally and generate the application. As of npm@5.2.0 we can now avoid this global install and instead use npx to generate the app on the fly to get the most current libraries and avoid many dependency conflicts.

Instead of this:
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app client

Just do this:
npx create-react-app client


Official docs on CRA usage with npx are available here:
