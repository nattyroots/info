.questions for redux:
  where do I store my app state in a complex React app?
  How do I create components that are actually reusable? \
  (because if I pass props to components, its creates tight connection of props to component and it brakes reusibility)

.what is redux 
  it is just a state container

.Three Principles
  Single source of truth
  State is read-only
  Changes are made with pure functions

.Actions
  allow to change redux store
  is an object that gets sent to the store
  example:
  {
      type: 'INCREMENT' //has to have type
  }
.store.dispach function
  gets the acctions to make change to the store

.store.subscribe 
  the function called everytime something changes in the state
  we can unsubscribe too

.I can add additional data to acction
